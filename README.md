# Plugins

Plugins offer a way to extend and integrate the core functionality of Medusa.

In most commerce solutions, you can extend the basic features but it often comes with the expense of having to build standalone web applications. Our architecture is built such that plugins run within the same process as the core eliminating the need for extra server capacity, infrastructure and maintenance. As a result, the plugins can use all other services as dependencies and access the database.
